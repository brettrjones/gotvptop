=== How to open port in Windows 10 firewall ===

Hopefully by the time NoLimitConnect is published this will be automated by applicaion
and these steps will not be required

1.) Open Windows Settings
2.) Click Network & Internet
3.) Click Windows Firewall
4.) Click Advanced Settings
5.) Click Inbound Rules
6.) Click New Rule
7.) Select Program then next
8.) Use the browse button to browse to NoLimitConnect.exe then next
9.) select Allow the connection then click Next
10.) check all boxes then click Next
11.) Give the rule a name like No Limit Connect Inbound Rule then finish
12.) VERY IMPORTANT: After rule is created select the rule from the list and click Properties
13.) In Advanced Tab change Edge Transverse to Allow edge transversal
14.) Apply and close out of dialogs

UPDATE: It seems that the above instructions did not work in all cases so here is a setup
that seems to always work (May have to restart computer after setup)
1.) follow steps 1 through 5 above to get to inbound rules
NOTE: for the following PATH_TO_APP means full path to application
	ie something like F:\nolimitconnect\bin-Windows\NoLimitConnect.exe
2.) Create the following Inbound rule
	General
		Name: NoLimitConnect (TCP-In-No Edge)
		Enabled: checked
		Action: Allow the Connection
	
	Programs and Services
		This Program: PATH_TO_APP
		Compartments: All compartments
		
	Protocols and Ports
		Protocol Type: TCP
		Local port: All Ports
		Remote port: All Ports
	
	Advanced
		Domain: checked
		Private: checked
		Public: checked
		Edge transversal: Block edge transversal
		
3.) Create another inbound rule same as above except
	General	
		Name: NoLimitConnect (TCP-In-Yes Edge)
		
	Advanced
		Edge transversal: Allow edge transversal
		
4.) Create Outbound Rule
